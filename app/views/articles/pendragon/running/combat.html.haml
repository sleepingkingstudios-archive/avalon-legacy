%h1.title Running the Game
%h2.subtitle Combat Encounters

%h2 Getting Started
%p
  Each participant rolls an Initiative check (normally, a Spirit check plus any
  applicable bonuses). In the case of a tie, the participant with the higher
  Spirit score acts first; if the Spirit scores are also tied, play a round of
  rock-paper-scissors, and the winning player's character acts first.
  
%h2 Combat Rounds and Turns
%p
  Combat is divided into rounds, each representing (very approximately) six
  seconds of in-game time. During each round, each participant acts once in
  order of their Initiative results, highest to lowest. This is the
  participant's Turn.
  %span.rewrite
    Any effects that have a set duration of Rounds will end at the beginning
    of that participant's turn in the final round of the effect.

%h3 Combat Actions
%p
  During their Turn, each participant can take one or more Actions.
  Specifically, a participant may take either a single full-round action, or a
  standard action, a move action, and a minor action. The player may substitute
  a move action for a standard action, or a minor action for a move action if
  desired, and may choose not to take all of the actions available in a given
  Turn.
  
%ul
  %li
    %strong Full-Round Action:
    %br
    An action that requires the creature's full focus for the entire round.
    Examples could include a chain of attacks, or a complex spell or ritual.
  %li
    %strong Standard Action:
    %br
    An action that requires time and focus, but allows the creature to move and
    take minor actions as well. Attacking an opponent with most weapons is a
    standard action, as is using many techniques.
  %li
    %strong Move Action:
    %br
    An action that takes some time and focus, but allows the creature to attack
    or cast a spell as well. Moving a short distance is a move action.
  %li
    %strong Minor Action:
    %br
    An action that takes minimal time and focus. Examples include drawing a
    sheathed weapon, opening a door, or grabbing a potion from a belt pouch
    (but not from a backpack or saddle bag).
  %li
    %strong Instant Action:
    %br
    An instant action is taken out of turn (see below). Examples include
    casting a counterspell to negate an enemy incantation or parrying an
    incoming attack.

%h3 Instant Actions
%p
  Some Techniques allow a creature to take an action outside of their Turn.
  These instant actions are in addition to the actions permitted above, but
  the technique can only be used when the specified condition is met. However,
  a creature can only take a single Instant action each round; once it has used
  any Instant action, it cannot take another until its next Turn.

%h2 Attacking the Enemy
%p
  This space unintentionally left blank. Caveat lector.

%h3 Attacks of Opportunity
%p
  Creatures may take an attack of opportunity as an Instant action.

%h2 Hit Points, Damage, and Wounds
%p
  Many effects inflict damage on a creature's opponents. The base unit of
  damage is the Token. Whenever a creature takes damage, place the appropriate
  number of Damage Tokens on that creature, up to a total number of damage
  tokens equal to the creature's hit points. Any remaining damage is instead
  converted to Wounds; place a number of Wound tokens on the creature equal to
  the remaining damage from the effect. Some effects can also apply wounds
  directly.
%p
  %span.rewrite
    A creature's hit points represent its ability to absorb or shrug off
    damage, whereas wounds represent sufficient damage to reduce the creature's
    combat effectiveness.
  Each wound token on a creature applies a cumulative -1 penalty to all checks,
  so a creature that has taken 3 wounds suffers a -3 penalty.
  
%h3 Unconsciousness
%p
  %span.rewrite
    When a creature takes damage, if the total of its damage and wounds exceeds
    its hit points, it must make an immediate Spirit check against a Difficulty
    of 10 + the amount of damage just taken.
  Remember to subtract the creature's wounds from the check result. On a failed
  check, the creature falls unconscious and cannot take any actions, even
  purely mental ones, until the creature is revived or rallies (see below).
%p
  Once per round during its turn, an unconscious creature can attempt to rally
  with a successful Spirit check (Difficulty 10). On a successful check, the
  creature is no longer unconscious and may act as normal during subsequent
  turns.
%p
  %span.rewrite
    An adjacent ally can attempt to revive a downed ally by making a successful
    Heal check against a Difficulty equal to 10 + the creature's total damage.
  Some effects can also immediately revive downed allies.

%h3 Death and Dying
%p
  If a creature's wounds ever exceed 6 + the creature's Body score, the
  creature dies. Dead creatures cannot take any actions, even purely mental
  ones, and cannot rally or be revived. Some effects can resurrect dead
  creatures within a short period after death (typically the duration of a
  combat encounter), but creatures that have been dead for a longer period,
  or whose physical forms have been destroyed, require the use of a
  resurrection ritual or quest to restore to life.
%p
  Some effects can also inflict death directly. A few environmental effects
  are similarly hazardous, such as falling into molten lava.
