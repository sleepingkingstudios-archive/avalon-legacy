%h1 Skills
%p
  Skills are what make Pendragon characters and creatures unique.

%h2 Reading the Skill Entries

%h3 Skill Name
%p
  At the top of the skill entry is the skill name. Each skill has a unique
  name, which reflects the nature and the effects of the skill.

%h3 Skill Type and Subtypes
%p
  Directly below the name is the skill type, which determines the requirements
  on or restrictions to using the skill, as well as what other effects can
  influence the use or the effect of the skill. Each skill has a single type,
  plus zero or more subtypes, which are listed in square brackets after the
  skill type.
%p
  The following types and subtypes have special requirements, restrictions, or
  other rules regarding their use. Other subtypes not listed only determine
  what other effects are triggered by or can influence the use of skills of
  that subtype.

%h4#instant Instant
%p
  The instant subtype indicates that the skill can be used out of the usual
  turn order, even in the middle of another creature's action. However, the
  skill can only be used immediately after the trigger condition is met (see
  Trigger, below).

%h4#magic Magic
%p
  The magic subtype indicates that the effect is powered by supernatural
  energies. Skills with the magic subtype typically require the user to spend
  mana tokens.
  
%h4#melee Melee
%p
  The melee subtype indicates that the user must make a successful melee attack
  check in order to use the skill. For techniques with the melee subtype, the
  check must be made using the specified equipment. If the user cannot make a
  melee attack (e.g. the target is out of reach), or if the check fails, then
  the skill fails.
%p
  If the skill is a technique, then unless otherwise noted the usual effect of
  a successful melee attack is applied to the target in addition to the effects
  of the technique.

%h4#projectile Projectile
%p
  As the melee subtype, above, except that the user must make a successful
  projectile attack in order to use the skill. Skills with the projectile
  subtype require a clear path to the target.

%h4#spell Spell
%p
  Spells are magical effects brought forth through ritual and incantation.
  Characters or creatures with roles such as &ldquo;sorcerer&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mystic&rdquo; make extensive use of spells.
%p
  Spells have no inherent restrictions or requirements, but most spellcasters
  have one or more restrictions on spell use, depending on the magical
  tradition they represent. In addition, spells always have the [Magic]
  subtype (see above), and are subject to the restrictions thereof.

%h4#technique Technique
%p
  Techniques are special abilities that use or require a piece of equipment, as
  determined by the full type, e.g. a &ldquo;Melee Weapon Technique&rdquo;
  requires the use of any melee weapon, and a &ldquo;Shield Technique&rdquo;
  requires the user to be wielding a shield. If the user is not wielding (or
  wearing, in the case of worn equipment) the specified equipment, then the
  creature or character cannot use that skill.
